We invite participation from many people to bring different perspectives to support this project. We pledge to do our part to foster a welcoming and professional environment free of harassment. We expect participants to communicate professionally and thoughtfully during their involvement with this project. Participants may lose their good standing by engaging in misconduct. For example: insulting, threatening, or conveying unwelcome sexual content. We ask participants who observe conduct issues to report the incident directly to the project's Response Team at opensource-conduct@verizonmedia.com . Verizon Media will assign a respondent to address the issue. We may remove harassers from this project. This code does not replace the terms of service or acceptable use policies of the websites used to support this project. We acknowledge that participants may be subject to additional conduct terms based on their employment which may govern their online expressions. Details \u00b6 This Code of Conduct makes our expectations of participants in this community explicit. * We forbid harassment and abusive speech within this community. * We request participants to report misconduct to the project\u2019s Response Team. * We urge participants to refrain from using discussion forums to play out a fight. Expected Behaviors \u00b6 We expect participants in this community to conduct themselves professionally. Since our primary mode of communication is text on an online forum (e.g. issues, pull requests, comments, emails, or chats) devoid of vocal tone, gestures, or other context that is often vital to understanding, it is important that participants are attentive to their interaction style. Assume positive intent. We ask community members to assume positive intent on the part of other people\u2019s communications. We may disagree on details, but we expect all suggestions to be supportive of the community goals. Respect participants. We expect participants will occasionally disagree. Even if we reject an idea, we welcome everyone\u2019s participation. Open Source projects are learning experiences. Ask, explore, challenge, and then respectfully assert if you agree or disagree. If your idea is rejected, be more persuasive not bitter. Welcoming to new members. New members bring new perspectives. Some may raise questions that have been addressed before. Kindly point them to existing discussions. Everyone is new to every project once. Be kind to beginners. Beginners use open source projects to get experience. They might not be talented coders yet, and projects should not accept poor quality code. But we were all beginners once, and we need to engage kindly. Consider your impact on others. Your work will be used by others, and you depend on the work of others. We expect community members to be considerate and establish a balance their self-interest with communal interest. Use words carefully. We may not understand intent when you say something ironic. Poe\u2019s Law suggests that without an emoticon people will misinterpret sarcasm. We ask community members to communicate plainly. Leave with class. When you wish to resign from participating in this project for any reason, you are free to fork the code and create a competitive project. Open Source explicitly allows this. Your exit should not be dramatic or bitter. Unacceptable Behaviors \u00b6 Participants remain in good standing when they do not engage in misconduct or harassment. To elaborate: * Don't be a bigot. Calling out project members by their identity or background in a negative or insulting manner. This includes, but is not limited to, slurs or insinuations related to protected or suspect classes e.g. race, color, citizenship, national origin, political belief, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, culture, ethnicity, genetic features, language, profession, national minority statue, mental or physical ability. * Don't insult. Insulting remarks about a person\u2019s lifestyle practices. * Don't dox. Revealing private information about other participants without explicit permission. * Don't intimidate. Threats of violence or intimidation of any project member. * Don't creep. Unwanted sexual attention or content unsuited for the subject of this project. * Don't disrupt. Sustained disruptions in a discussion. * Let us help. Refusal to assist the Response Team to resolve an issue in the community. We do not list all forms of harassment, nor imply some forms of harassment are not worthy of action. Any participant who feels harassed or observes harassment, should report the incident. Victim of harassment should not address grievances in the public forum, as this often intensifies the problem. Report it, and let us address it off-line. Reporting Issues \u00b6 If you experience or witness misconduct, or have any other concerns about the conduct of members of this project, please report it by contacting our Response Team at opensource-conduct@verizonmedia.com who will handle your report with discretion. Your report should include: * Your preferred contact information. We cannot process anonymous reports. * Names (real or usernames) of those involved in the incident. * Your account of what occurred, and if the incident is ongoing. Please provide links to or transcripts of the publicly available records (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), so that we can review it. * Any additional information that may be helpful to achieve resolution. After filing a report, a representative will contact you directly to review the incident and ask additional questions. If a member of the Verizon Media Response Team is named in an incident report, that member will be recused from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the Response Team, it will be addressed by a different member of the Response Team. We will consider reports to be confidential for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. Scope \u00b6 Verizon Media will assign a Response Team member with admin rights on the project and legal rights on the project copyright. The Response Team is empowered to restrict some privileges to the project as needed. Since this project is governed by an open source license, any participant may fork the code under the terms of the project license. The Response Team\u2019s goal is to preserve the project if possible, and will restrict or remove participation from those who disrupt the project.

Rationale \u00b6 This utility provides a single place to configure gloabal/operating system dependencies and simplifies creating CI/CD Pipelines that install and build the same package for multiple different operating system environments in a coherent manner. Configuration \u00b6 The screwdrivercd_install_deps utility is configured using the pyproject.toml file. The pyproject.toml file is a toml format configuration file, that is defined as part of Python PEP518 to hold the python package build dependencies. All of the configuration for the screwdrivercd.installdeps package are under the is under the tool.sdv4_installdeps section which contains the configuration values for the tool as a whole and subsections that define the configuration to use for each package type. pyproject.toml tool.sdv4_installdeps configuration \u00b6 The tool.sdv4_installdeps configuration section defines settings that configure how the utility functions. fail_on_error \u00b6 Boolean (True/False) value indicating if the installer should immediately fail if a package installation fails. The default value is False [tool.sdv4_installdeps] fail_on_error = true install \u00b6 The install configuration setting is an ordered list of the package utilities to run. Optional If not provided, a default that will run all the package utilities, ordered to execute the system package utilities, followed by the global python pip3 installed packages. [tool.sdv4_installdeps] install = ['apk', 'apt-get', 'brew', 'yum', 'pip3'] Package section \u00b6 Each package tool has a setting section under the tool.sdv4_installdeps section of the pyproject.toml . Common Package settings \u00b6 All the package tools have some settings that are common among them, so the same settings have the same format irregardless of the package utility they are defined under. deps \u00b6 The deps setting is a list of package dependencies in a format based on the Python PEP 508 Package dependency specification. The specification used by the screwdrivercd.installdeps package adds the following environment markers which contain values from the distro package to allow specifying requirements based on attributes of the Operating System distribution. Marker Python equivalent Sample values distro_codename distro.codename() Maipo, bionic distro_id distro.id() rhel, ubuntu, darwin distro_like distro.like() fedora, debian distro_name distro.name() Darwin, Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server, Ubuntu distro_version distro.version() 7.4, 18.04, 18.6.0 For example, the snippet below will use the yum tool to install the foo_python36 package from the foo python rpm repo if the Operating System version is less than 8.0 and install the python3 package if the operating system is version 8.0 or higher. [tool.sdv4_installdeps.yum] repos . foo = 'https://foo.bar.com/foo_rpms.repo;distro_version<\"8.0\"' deps = [ 'foo_python36;distro_version<\"8.0\"' , 'python3;distro_version>=\"8.0' ] repos (Optional) \u00b6 Some package utilities have the concept of package repositories. The repos setting is a dictionary of repository name and values for repositories to add. This setting is only valid for the package utilities that have this concept. The repo setting can be used to define package repositories to add to the host configuration before installing the package dependencies. Like the deps setting, this setting supports using environment markers to specify environments to add the repositories too. For example, this snippet would add the foo yum/rpm repository before installing the packages in Operating system versions lower than 8.0. [tool.sdv4_installdeps.yum] repos . foo_rpms = 'https://foo.bar.com/foo_rpms.repo;distro_version<\"8.0\"' apk settings \u00b6 The apk utility does not support repositories.

[tool.sdv4_installdeps.brew] deps = ['python3'] yum settings \u00b6 The yum tools supports both repos and deps settings.

The yum utility configuration supports enabling/disabling repos in addition to being able to add/remove them. A repo configuration value that begins with enable: will enable the repository instead of adding it. A repo configuraiton value that begins with disable will disable the repository instead of adding it. repos . foo_rpms = 'https://foo.bar.com/foo_rpms.repo' repos . foo_rpms_disable_stable = 'disable:foo_rpms-stable' repos . foo_rpms_enable_beta = 'enable:foo_rpms-beta' pip3 settings \u00b6 The pip3 tool supports using the python pip3 command to install python packages for global, system wide use.
